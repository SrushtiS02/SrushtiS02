## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

🔹 **🌊 PhaseFormer + CLIP for Underwater Image Enhancement**  
Developing a CLIP-routed transformer pipeline to restore real-world underwater images across multiple conditions.  
→ *Adaptive routing, semantic enhancement, and novel loss functions*

🔹 **🧬 Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-rays**  
Applied transfer learning with VGG16 and Grad-CAM to classify and explain pneumonia presence in medical images.  
→ *Achieved 94% accuracy on unseen data*

🔹 **📊 Bayesian Voting & Depression Analysis**  
Modeled the relationship between mental health and voting patterns using multilevel Bayesian regression in `brms`
